  The `startFunctionContext()` rpc call can be used to prepare the handover of an openOBD session to another service that may perform
  a diagnostic function.

  This function is executed within its own function context. The `FunctionCall` message contains the definition of the function id that
  will be executed. It will also get its own function instance id that is unique identifier that can be used to address this specific function execution.

  This rpc call can *only* be made within an openOBD session that is in the 'available' state. It is not possible to create a context on an openOBD session when it is in the 'active' state.
  The 'active' state needs to be released first using the `finish()` rpc call.

  !!! note

    The `startFunctionContext()` call is not required, i.e. it is possible to run operations that are not in the context of a an (external) function

  A successful call to this `startFunctionContext()` rpc will yield a monitor token (contained in FunctionContext message). This monitor token is exclusively used for calls to the `monitorFunctionContext()` service.
  This allows for monitoring the freshly created function context and informs the listener when the function context is being finished.

  /*
  This function can be used to monitor the execution of a procedure in a function context. This procedure might be running on another host.

  A monitor token must be sent as bearer token in the header with every request. This monitor token is retrieved by the `startFunctionContext()` call.
  The incoming stream will provide the caller with regular updates on the state of the openOBD session.
  An update will contain (comparable to the `openSessionTokenStream()` rpc) a fresh monitor token. The caller needs to regularly
  update its monitor token for the `monitorFunctionContext()` function call. In case the connection is lost, a recent monitor token needs to be used to reconnect.

  A function context can be closed by calling the `finish()` rpc. The `finish()` call can only be made by the process that is authenticated to (i.e. activated) the openOBD session.
  The last FunctionContext received over the `monitorFunctionContext()` incoming stream will contain a fresh authentication token that can be used to resume operation on the openOBD session by the calling procedure.

  /*
  The `registerFunctionDetails()` call links the function details (like function id, name etc.) to the current function context. The function broker uses this information for correct administration of which functions are being called.
  When this call is repeated within the same function context it will:

    - Succeed when it uses the same function id
    - Fail when it uses a different function id

  The function broker ensures that the function id that is requested by a client matches the function id that is registered in the function context.
  If the function broker fails to successfully call the `registerFunctionDetails()` method, this will result in a failing function call.

  In the case that no function details have been registered yet, the first call to `registerFunctionDetails()` registers the function details like the id, name and description. This will always be successful.

  When the `authenticate()` call is made without first calling the `registerFunctionDetails()` method, then the registered function id will be set to match the uniquely created function context id.

  !!! note

    This function registers function details like name, description, version. It is however **NOT** required to initialize the function details before a `runFunction()` call.
    In the end, the function broker will always make the `registerFunctionDetails()` call before actually passing a function call to the function launcher.
