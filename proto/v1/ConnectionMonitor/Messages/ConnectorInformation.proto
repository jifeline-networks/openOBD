   If your application requires LOW latency, do NOT use the `healthy` flag.
   The `healthy` flag indicates whether a connection is stable based on the
   last 10 latency samples and an average latency below 500 ms. This variable is calculated
   by taking the weighted average of latency values higher than the average latency
   (error rate), then converted into a percentage and checked if it is
   less than 75%. If it is less than 75%, then the connection is considered to be healthy.
   Otherwise, it is not.
